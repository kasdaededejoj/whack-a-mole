## Round 2 Speed Tuning + Nuka Keycap Lerp — 2026-07-03

## Committed & pushed to `main` (31ff9a5)

- **Descent speeds scaled ×4.17** — all `INV_WAVE_CONFIG` `descentSpeed`
  values raised proportionally from the 0.12 baseline to 0.5:
  wave 1: 0.12→0.5, wave 2: 0.18→0.75, wave 3: 0.26→1.08,
  wave 4: 0.35→1.46, wave 5: 0.48→2.0. Fallback also updated to 0.5.
- **`INV_BULLET_SPEED` raised from 7 to 28** (×4 multiplier, matching
  the descent scale to keep relative feel consistent). Nuka bullet
  still fires at `×0.5` (14px/frame). All other bullets at full 28.
- **Nuka keycap lerped opacity on cooldown.** Added
  `lerpNukaKeycapOpacity()` (cubic ease-in-out, 400ms), called by two
  new helpers: `showNukaKeycapCooldown()` fades keycap to 0.35 opacity
  on cooldown start; `restoreNukaKeycapOpacity()` fades it back to 1.0
  when cooldown ends. Both called from `startNukaCooldown()`.
  `hideNukaPrompt()` and `stopInvaders()` cancel the lerp rAF cleanly.
- **Nuka keycap letter `font-weight` 700→400** for a thinner glyph.

## Bullet Speed Revert + No-Cache Fix — 2026-07-03

## Committed & pushed to `main` (2711555)

- **AOE bullet speed reduction reverted.** Earlier today `spawnBullet()`
  was changed to fire AOE-upgrade bullets at `×0.75` speed — Adam
  clarified the intent: only the **Nuka bullet** (`×0.5`) should be
  slowed. All other bullets (including AOE/missile upgrade bullets) fire
  at full `INV_BULLET_SPEED=7`. `getRound2DebugInfo()` updated to match.
- **No-cache meta tags added to `index.html`.** Root cause of the
  recurring "changes aren't visible" issue: GitHub Pages CDN was serving
  stale `index.html` (and by extension stale JS modules) after deploys.
  Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` + `Pragma`
  + `Expires` meta tags. These instruct browsers to always revalidate
  the HTML on load, which in turn forces fresh fetches of all JS
  modules. Won't affect load performance meaningfully (assets still
  served from CDN edge; only the revalidation check is added). If
  caching issues persist after this, the next step would be a GitHub
  Pages `_headers` file or query-string versioning on each JS import.

## Live Dev Overlay + Deploy Flakiness Note — 2026-07-03

## Committed & pushed to `main` (ec17f9d)

- **New "live overlay" toggle inside the existing Shift+D dev panel.**
  Unlike opening the dev panel itself (which still pauses the game via
  `state.running=false`), this toggle does NOT pause anything — it drops
  a small fixed corner HUD (`#dev-live-overlay`, updated every 200ms via
  `setInterval`) that keeps running during actual gameplay. Shows,
  per active round:
  - Round 1: spawn interval (ms), max alive, moles alive
  - Round 2: wave number (+ boss flag), descent speed, base vs.
    effective bullet speed (accounts for the AOE ×0.75 multiplier),
    Nuka bullet speed, active upgrade, whether the render loop
    (`invRaf`) is alive — this last one directly surfaces the exact
    ghost-rAF failure mode from earlier today if it ever recurs.
  - Round 3: player/enemy HP, current phase.
  Implemented via small `getRoundNDebugInfo()` getters exported from
  each round module (`round1.js`, `round2.js`, `round3.js`), read by
  `devpanel.js`. Purely additive — no existing exports/behavior changed.

## Deploy flakiness observed, not fully explained

- Since fixing the Pages source/workflow setup, deploys have gone
  failure → success → failure → success in immediate alternation, always
  with the same generic `"Deployment failed, try again later."` message
  and no other error detail. The workflow config itself matches GitHub's
  official templates exactly (checkout → configure-pages →
  upload-pages-artifact → deploy-pages, correct permissions). Current
  read: this is backend flakiness on GitHub's end, not a config problem
  — but if it keeps failing more than ~50% of the time going forward,
  worth revisiting (possibly the `github-pages` environment still
  settling after the source-type switch, or genuine Pages incident).
  Retry pattern that's worked so far: push again (a trivial commit is
  enough) rather than trying to re-run the failed job via API — the API
  re-run endpoint needs `actions: write` PAT scope, which hasn't been
  granted.

## Open thread carried into next session

- Adam reported the game feeling globally slower starting from **Round
  1, wave 1** — before any Round 2/Nuka-specific code even runs. No
  code in this session touched Round 1 or base movement speed, and
  `INV_WAVE_CONFIG` values are unchanged from before today. Leading
  theory was stale cache, but this needs to actually be re-tested now
  that the live overlay exists — check Round 1's reported
  `spawnIntervalMs` against the hardcoded `800` in `round1.js` to
  confirm whether the runtime value itself is off, or whether it's a
  perception/deploy-timing issue.

## GitHub Pages Deployment Fix — 2026-07-03

## Root cause found and fixed

Every fix pushed earlier today (freeze fix, layout fix, Nuka boss fix,
VFX) looked "not there" on the live site because **the deploy was
silently failing**, not because of caching. Repo Pages settings had
`build_type: "legacy"` (deploy-from-branch) while a `pages build and
deployment` Actions workflow was also trying to deploy — the two
collided, the build step always succeeded but the deploy step failed on
every single push. Fixed by Adam changing Settings → Pages → Source from
"Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions". Confirmed via API
(`GET /repos/.../pages`) that `build_type` is now `"workflow"`.

Re-triggering a deploy requires either re-running the failed Actions job
(needs Actions:write on the PAT, which the current one doesn't have) or
a fresh push (works fine with the existing Contents:write PAT) — used
the latter. If deploys still show red after this, check
Settings → Pages again first before assuming it's a code bug.

## Bullet Speed Tuning + Nuka Boss Fix — 2026-07-03

## Committed & pushed to `main` (b368ad8)

- **AOE upgrade bullets** now fire at `INV_BULLET_SPEED*0.75` (25% slower)
  instead of the flat speed shared with every other bullet type.
- **Nuka bullet** speed changed from `×0.85` to `×0.5` (50% slower).
- **Nuka in the boss wave now actually does something.** Root cause:
  Nuka's payoff is an instant grid row-clear (`aliveRows`/`.row`-based),
  but the boss entity has no `.row`, so a successful check found nothing
  to clear. The only remaining effect was the Nuka bullet itself, fired
  straight up from wherever the shooter happened to be — while the boss
  drifts side to side — so it almost always missed. Net effect: the
  skill felt broken/unavailable against the boss even though it was
  technically still activating. Fixed by branching in
  `resolveNukaInput()`: on `invWave===5`, a successful check now deals a
  **guaranteed flat 25 damage** directly to the boss (bypassing the
  bullet-collision path entirely), mirrors the existing boss-hit/death
  handling (HP display in `msgEl`, combo increment, death cleanup), and
  spawns a new **purple haze bomb** particle effect (`isNukaBomb`, radial
  gradient glow + expanding ring in `invDraw()`) at the boss's position
  for a proper payoff visual, since there was no existing boss-specific
  VFX for this skill to reuse.
- Balance number (25 dmg) came directly from Adam — boss has
  `INV_BOSS_HP=313`, a normal bullet hit deals `7`, so this is a
  meaningfully bigger, guaranteed hit that still requires ~13 successful
  checks to solo the boss with Nuka alone (cooldown-gated, ~3.5s per
  success), not a one-shot.

## Round 2 Layout Fix + Nuka UI Tracking — 2026-07-03

## Committed & pushed to `main` (b1d455f)

- **Field now starts at the true top of the screen.** Root cause:
  `startInvaders()` hid Round I's `.hud` via `visibility='hidden'`, which
  keeps its layout space reserved even though nothing renders there, and
  never hid `.bar-wrap` (Round I's countdown timer bar) at all — both
  sat in the flex column above `.field`, pushing Round II's canvas down.
  Fixed by switching to `display='none'` for both in `startInvaders()`,
  restored via `display=''` in `stopInvaders()`.
- **Nuka keycap + cooldown bar now track the shooter sprite** instead of
  being pinned to a fixed bottom-right screen position. Added
  `positionNukaUI()` in `round2.js`, called every frame from
  `invUpdate()`, which reads the canvas's bounding rect + `invShooterX`
  and positions `#nuka-keycap`/`#nuka-cooldown` (now `left/top` +
  `transform:translate(...)` driven, previously static `right/bottom`
  CSS) just to the right of the sprite as it follows the mouse.

## Still open

- Nuka keycap glyph centering (the letter *inside* the keycap box) —
  Adam confirmed the `padding-top:0.09em` nudge from the previous
  session made no visible difference. Needs a fresh look once the
  reposition above is confirmed working, ideally with a screenshot
  since further blind CSS nudges without visual feedback aren't
  reliable.
- `state.js` invader-state duplicate cleanup already done by Codex
  (see `10fd34f`) — confirmed safe, nothing outside `round2.js` read
  those fields.

## Documentation Workflow Definitions — 2026-07-03

## Committed & pushed to `main`

- Updated `agent.md` with the project's small-change vs big-change documentation
  rules.

## Files modified

- `agent.md`
- `HANDOVER.md`

## What changed

- Defined a **small change** as something the next assistant can understand
  without extra story: typo fixes, broken doc links, label wording, tiny visual
  tweaks, or obvious dead-code cleanup.
- Defined a **big change** as anything where the next assistant would ask why
  the project behaves that way: gameplay bug fixes, round behavior changes,
  architecture/module wiring changes, new features, removed or moved code,
  startup flow changes, event listener changes, scoring/timing/difficulty/wave/
  cooldown changes, or bug fixes with a root cause.
- Clarified that `HANDOVER.md` should be updated when a change affects gameplay,
  architecture, bug history, testing status, workflow, or future AI
  decision-making. Also use it for extended handoff context, unresolved work,
  complex sessions, or when nearing the end of the active assistant context
  window.
- Updated this file's standing rule so it no longer says every tiny change must
  always receive a handover entry.

## Root cause / workflow issue

- The previous standing instruction treated every change as handover-worthy,
  which created unnecessary documentation overhead and could make the handover
  noisy for non-coding collaborators and future AI sessions.

## Solution implemented

- Added a practical small/big change rule to `agent.md`.
- Mirrored the workflow change in this `HANDOVER.md` entry because it affects
  how future assistants should decide what to document.

## Remaining known issues

- None for this documentation workflow change.

## Follow-up tasks

- Future assistants should apply this rule when deciding whether to update
  `HANDOVER.md` after a pushed change.

## Round 2 Nuka Freeze Sync Check — 2026-07-03

## Committed & pushed to `main`

- **`10fd34f`** — Removed stale Round 2/Nuka duplicate fields from
  `state.js` after checking the current JavaScript files against the
  Nuka freeze fix.

## Files modified

- `js/state.js`
- `HANDOVER.md`

## What changed

- Confirmed the actual Nuka freeze fix is present in `js/rounds/round2.js`:
  `invLoop()` now re-checks `state.running`/`invCanvas` immediately after
  `invUpdate()` returns, before drawing or scheduling another
  `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Confirmed `game.js` imports `handleInvaderKeydown` from `round2.js` and
  attaches it during `initGame()`, so Space/Nuka prompt keyboard handling is
  wired through the module graph.
- Removed unused invader/Nuka state copies from `state.js`:
  `invCanvas`, `invCtx`, `invRaf`, invader entity/bullet/particle fields,
  invader config constants, `invWave`, `invUpgrade`, AOE fields, and Nuka
  cooldown/prompt fields.
- `round2.js` remains the active owner of Round 2 runtime state and config.

## Root cause / sync issue

- The Nuka freeze fix was already synced into the active Round 2 engine, but
  `state.js` still contained duplicate invader/Nuka fields left over from the
  modular refactor.
- Those duplicated fields were not read or written by `round2.js`, `game.js`,
  or other modules, which made `state.js` look like a competing source of
  truth even though it was dead data.

## Solution implemented

- Searched the repository for `state.INV_WAVE_CONFIG`,
  `state.INV_BULLET_SPEED`, `state.invRaf`, and
  `state.invNukaSkillActive`; no live references were found.
- Removed the stale duplicates from `state.js` instead of rewiring Round 2,
  preserving the existing working Round 2 module ownership.

## Remaining known issues

- Local browser/dev-server QA was not available in this Codex workspace; user
  will verify through GitHub Pages.
- `READ ME.md` still points to `AGENTS.md`, but the actual repository file is
  `agent.md`. This was observed during session startup and is a small future
  documentation cleanup.
- Round II still needs a full live playtest from Wave 1 through Boss before
  feature lock.

## Follow-up tasks

- Test Round II through GitHub Pages, specifically choosing Nuka at Wave 4 and
  confirming the loop continues after the skill prompt resolves.
- If Round II pacing still feels slow, check `js/rounds/round2.js` directly;
  it is the current source of truth for invader wave speeds.
- Consider correcting the `READ ME.md` project-direction link from
  `AGENTS.md` to `agent.md` in a future docs pass.

## Round 2 Nuka Freeze Fix + Cleanup — 2026-07-03

## Fixed, staged (not yet pushed — see Process notes)

- **Round 2 Nuka freeze (open bug #1 from 2026-07-02, now fixed).** Root
  cause: `invLoop()` only checked `state.running`/`invCanvas` at the top
  of the function, before calling `invUpdate()`. But `invUpdate()` can
  itself stop the round mid-call — specifically, clearing wave 4 calls
  `nextInvaderWave()` → `showUpgradeModal()`, which sets
  `state.running=false` and nulls `invRaf` to "kill the loop cleanly."
  Control then returns into the *same* `invLoop()` invocation, which
  didn't re-check anything — it called `invDraw()` and unconditionally
  did `invRaf=requestAnimationFrame(invLoop)`, silently overwriting the
  `null` that was just set. That queued one "ghost" frame; when it fired
  (~16ms later, while the upgrade modal was still up), it saw
  `state.running` was false and returned early — but without resetting
  `invRaf`, leaving it holding a stale, already-fired, non-null ID
  forever. When the player then picked the Nuka upgrade,
  `startNukaSkill()`'s `if(!invRaf) invLoop()` restart check saw a
  non-null `invRaf` and never restarted the loop — permanently freezing
  the render/update cycle while the wave still spawned in memory and the
  (DOM-based, loop-independent) Nuka keycap prompt still displayed,
  matching the reported symptom exactly. Fixed by re-checking
  `state.running`/`invCanvas` immediately after `invUpdate()` returns,
  before `invDraw()`/rescheduling.
- Nuka keycap glyph centering + border, in `index.html`: border thinned
  from `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2)` to `0.75px solid
  rgba(255,255,255,0.14)`; added `line-height:1` + `padding-top:0.09em`
  as a fixed optical-center nudge (flexbox centers by line-box, not
  glyph visual weight, which is why straight vs. curved characters sat
  differently). Note: this is an approximate, uniform nudge — true
  per-glyph centering would need per-character metrics, not attempted.
- Removed the temporary debug label from `invDraw()` in `round2.js`
  (`[debug] wave N · descentSpeed=... · bulletSpeed=...` canvas text),
  flagged for removal since `f889ca3`.
- Docs: `agent.md` and `READ ME.md` architecture sections updated from
  "Single-file `index.html`" to reflect the actual modular `js/` split.

## Known residual, not addressed this session

- `state.js` declares `invNukaSkillActive`, `invNukaCooldownUntil`,
  `invNukaPromptLetter`, `invNukaCooldownTimer`, `invNukaCooldownRaf` on
  the shared `state` object, but `round2.js` never reads/writes them —
  it keeps its own identically-named local closure variables instead.
  Dead/confusing duplication left over from the refactor; worth removing
  from `state.js` in a future pass, but not touched here to keep this
  batch surgical.

## Process notes

- Standing instruction from Adam: **update this file at the end of every
  session by default**, not just when asked — he's running multiple AI
  sessions/devices against this repo, so this file is the only shared
  source of truth between them.
- Adam's stance on the PAT-in-chat push workflow: he's aware pasting a
  token in-conversation exposes it, and is fine with that risk for this
  repo specifically — it's a game/marketing artifact, not a production
  or sensitive system. Still generate scoped, short-expiry tokens and
  revoke after use as a baseline habit, but don't over-flag the
  exposure itself in future sessions.
- This session's edits are sitting in the sandbox only — no GitHub
  connector is available in this chat surface, and pushing needs a
  fresh fine-grained PAT (Contents: Read and write, scoped to this repo,
  shortest expiry) pasted in-conversation for a one-time push, revoked
  immediately after use per the existing rule below.

## Round 2/3 Refactor Fixes — 2026-07-02

## Committed & pushed to `main` (live on GitHub)

- **`2b55ab2`** — Fixed `state.js`: it was exporting individually-named
  bindings, imported elsewhere via `import * as state`. That style of
  import is read-only in ES modules — any write to it (`state.currentRound
  = 1`, etc.) threw a `TypeError` immediately. This was the root cause of
  "half the components missing" after the modular refactor. Fixed by
  exporting one mutable `state` object instead, and updating the imports
  in `game.js`, `audio.js`, `ui.js`, `round1.js` to match
  (`import { state } from './state.js'`).

- **`019c5d0`** — Fixed `round2.js` and `round3.js`: both files had **zero
  import statements** — they were copy-pasted from the old single-file
  monolith with no wiring to the other modules (`state.js`, `ui.js`,
  `audio.js`, `game.js`). Every reference to shared values (`running`,
  `combo`, `field`, `msgEl`, `sfxMuted`, etc.) was undefined, throwing
  immediately. Also restored a missing `requestAnimationFrame`
  self-scheduling call at the end of `duelDrawFrame()` in `round3.js` —
  that missing line was the actual cause of the Round 3 freeze (it drew
  exactly one frame and stopped).

- **`fb07ab5` → `f889ca3`** — Pushed from a separate session (different
  device, same project). Wired up the Nuka skill's keyboard input
  (previously missing). Iterated Round 2 wave descent speed up to 4x the
  original pre-refactor baseline. Left a **temporary debug label** on the
  Round 2 canvas showing live `descentSpeed`/`bulletSpeed` values, added
  to confirm the browser wasn't serving a cached version. Marked
  "TEMP DEBUG — remove once confirmed" in its own comment — still needs
  removing.

## Committed & pushed in this same batch

- `state.js`: wave descent speed reduced from 4x → 3x original baseline,
  per request:
  ```js
  const INV_WAVE_CONFIG = [
    {cols: 8, rows: 4, descentSpeed: 0.36, hpTop: 2, hpRest: 1},
    {cols: 8, rows: 4, descentSpeed: 0.54, hpTop: 2, hpRest: 1},
    {cols: 9, rows: 4, descentSpeed: 0.78, hpTop: 3, hpRest: 1},
    {cols: 9, rows: 5, descentSpeed: 1.05, hpTop: 3, hpRest: 2},
    {cols: 10, rows: 5, descentSpeed: 1.44, hpTop: 4, hpRest: 2},
    null,
  ];
  ```

## Open bugs — not yet diagnosed or fixed

1. **Round 2 freezes when the Nuka skill triggers.** Not yet
   investigated — needs a look at `resolveNukaInput` / the
   Nuka-clear-effect logic in `round2.js` (from `fb07ab5`) to find what
   halts the wave loop.
2. **Nuka's on-screen letter prompt** needs the key glyph centered on
   straight characters (not resting on the visual baseline of curved
   ones), with a thinner outline stroke.
3. Remove the temporary debug label added in `f889ca3` once no longer
   needed for diagnosis.

## Process notes for whoever picks this up next

- **Claude sessions do not share live file state across chats or
  devices**, even under the same account. Memory carries over *facts*
  about the project, not working files or in-progress edits. GitHub is
  the actual source of truth between sessions — always `git fetch` and
  check `git log origin/main` before assuming local state is current.
- There is no GitHub connector available in this chat surface. Pushing
  requires manually generating a fine-grained Personal Access Token
  (Contents: Read and write, scoped to this repo only, shortest
  expiry) and pasting it in-conversation for a one-time push. Revoke it
  from GitHub immediately after each session that uses one.
- `README.md`/`agent.md` still describe the architecture as "Single-file
  `index.html`" — that's stale since the modular `js/` split. Worth
  updating so it reflects reality.
